        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to build the "frame" of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.  
            In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file. </li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>CSS provides the color and styling for our webpage.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS allows a developer style an element directing in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specfic HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.
              They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible
            than external and internal style sheets.
          </li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The rules of an internal style sheet applies to all tagged page elements of that page.</li>
          <li>External style shet is the most preferred as it allows developers keep their CSS rules in a separate file. 
            This allows for flexibility and makes it easer to edit the CSS rules.
          </li>
          <li> CSS rules consist of a selector and at least one delcaration.  A delcaration contains the property and 
            value associated with that property.
          </li>
          <li>Margin is how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding is how much space we want around the inside of an element.</li>
          <li>A class attribute allows us to add styles to certain elements, but all the elements.</li>
          <li>CSS stylesheets are linked in the head element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>always work on a feature branch</li>
          <li>It is important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub.
            Working on an outdated version can lead to big sync problems. 
          </li>
          <li>git pull origin main: syncs our local branch with the remote branch in GitHub</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds our changes to the staging area</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript makes a static HTML/CSS webpage interactive.</li>
          <li>Think of JavaScript as all the things we can interact with in our house.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>JavaScript files are linked in the body element.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes a script. 
            JavaScript runs code sequentially.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>An array is variable that represents a group of related data.</li>
          <li>For loops consist of the keyword 'for' followed by three-part conditional statement, then code block.</li>
